The WHO 2021 classification criteria for adult-type diffuse glioma integrate histology with molecular profiling for conclusive diagnosis. Since molecular profiling can be expensive and time-consuming, often necessitating outsourcing or leading to the "not otherwise specified (NOS) label," this study develops an AI-driven WHO 2021 classification of gliomas solely from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs).
