The WHO 2021 classification criteria for adult-type diffuse glioma integrate histology with molecular profiling for conclusive diagnosis. Since molecular profiling can be expensive and time-consuming, often necessitating outsourcing or leading to the "not otherwise specified (NOS) label," this study develops an AI-driven WHO 2021 classification of gliomas solely from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs).


## Environment
### Pre-requisites
* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
* NVIDIA GPU (Tested on Nvidia A6000/A100)

Next, use the environment configuration file to create a conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -n glioma_subtyping -f glioma_subtyping.yaml
```

Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate glioma_subtyping
```

## WSI Patching and Curation

```bash
data/wsi/<DATASET>
	├── patient_1_slide_a.svs
	├── patient_1_slide_b.svs
	└── ...
data/wsi/<DATASET>
	├── patient_2_slide_a.svs
	├── patient_2_slide_b.svs
	└── ...
```


### 🛠 Workflow Logic

The pipeline automatically adjusts the extraction scale and file paths based on the input magnification. 
This ensures that the physical area covered by a patch remains consistent or follows your specific protocol.

| Input Argument | Target Data Directory | Output Directory | Patch Size | Down Sample Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `40x` | `data/slides_40x/` | `data/slides_patches/` | **512** | `2` |
| `20x` | `data/slides_20x/` | `data/slides_patches/` | **256** | `1` | 


### Patch Creation at Multiple Magnifications

Some datasets provide Whole Slide Images (WSIs) with pyramid downsample levels  
`1, 2, 4, 8, 16`.  
We map these levels to effective optical magnifications as follows:

| Pyramid Level | Effective Magnification | Openslide Level |
|--------------:|------------------------:| --------------: |
| 1             | 40x (native resolution) | 0               |
| 2             | 20x                     | 1               |
| 4             | 10x                     | 2               |
| 8             | 5x                      | 3               |
| 16            | 2.5x                    | 4               |

Based on this mapping, patches are extracted using the following conventions:

- **20x / 10x / 5x / 2.5x**  
  - `step_size = 256`  
  - `patch_size = 256`  
- **40x**  
  - `step_size = 512`  
  - `patch_size = 512`

---

#### Create Patches Script

The `create_patches.sh` script takes the following arguments:

```bash
./create_patches.sh <DATASET> <MAG> <PATCH_SIZE> <PATCH_LEVEL>

Examples: 
./script/create_patches.sh tcga 20x 256 0 #20x (Pyramid Level = 2)
./script/create_patches.sh tcga 10x 256 1 #10x (Pyramid Level = 4)
./script/create_patches.sh tcga 5x 256 2 #5x (Pyramid Level = 8)
./script/create_patches.sh tcga 2.5x 256 3 #2.5x (Pyramid Level = 16)
```


#### Output Directory Structure
```bash
data/patches/<DATASET>/<MAG>/
	├── masks
    		├── patient_1_slide_a.png
    		├── patient_1_slide_b.png
    		└── ...
	├── patches
    		├── patient_1_slide_a.h5
    		├── patient_1_slide_b.h5
    		└── ...
	├── stitches
    		├── patient_1_slide_a.png
    		├── patient_1_slide_b.png
    		└── ...
	└── slides_processed.csv
```

### 🧹 Patch Cleanup (Step 2)
After initial patching, the pipeline runs a **Cleanup Script** to filter out low-quality tiles. (if needed)
#### Filtering Criteria:
1. **White Space**: Patches with >85% background are removed.
2. **Stain Detection**: Uses HED (Hematoxylin-Eosin-DAB) color deconvolution to ensure tissue is actually present.
3. **HSV Filtering**: Removes blurry or out-of-focus areas based on saturation and value thresholds.

After patch extraction, a cleanup step is performed to remove invalid or unused patches based on the patching magnification.
Run the cleanup script as follows:

```bash
python step_2_cleanup.py \
    --wsi_dir "$DATA_DIR" \
    --h5_dir "$COORD_DIR/patches" \
    --csv_path "$COORD_DIR/slides_processed.csv" \
    --patching "$MAG"
```
Arguments:
- `--wsi_dir` : directory containing the original WSI files
- `--h5_dir` : directory containing extracted patch coordinate `.h5` files
- `--csv_path` — CSV file generated during patch creation (`slides_processed.csv`)
- `--patching` — magnification level used for patch extraction (e.g., `20x`, `10x`, `5x`, `2.5x`)


## Creating Features
This script performs **patch-level feature extraction** using a selected backbone model.  
It supports multiple **self-supervised and supervised histopathology encoders** and automatically selects the appropriate feature-extraction wrapper.

```bash
./script/extract_features.sh <MAG> <BATCH_SIZE> <CSV_FILE> <BACKBONE> <DATASET>
``` 

Example: 
```shell
chmod +x extract_features.sh
./script/extract_features.sh 20x 128 tcga_2021_who_labels.csv uni tcga
```

Arguments:
- `MAG` — magnification level (e.g., `20x`, `10x`, `5x`, `2.5x`)
- `BATCH_SIZE` — batch size for feature extraction (e.g., `128`)
- `CSV_FILE` — dataset CSV file (located in `dataset_csv/`)
